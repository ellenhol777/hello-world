Ellen here ... new to Github
Currently taking the data science specialization course 1 from Johns Hopkins University: The Data Scientist's Toolbox.
My goal is to learn Statistics and programming in R (course 2 from this specialization), which I need for the Basic Statistics course (course 3 from the Methods and Statistics in Social Sciences Specialization from the University of Amsterdam)
